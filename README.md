# TheNewsLab


The aim of this project is to create a new kind of community, bringing together readers of the news from all political biases.

TheNewsLab will be a forum where the top 10 articles from the most popular news outlets are highlighted. The articles will be divided based on where the article is published.

 Readers will be invited to engage in debate with other readers, and who don't necessarily share their world view or political persuasion.
